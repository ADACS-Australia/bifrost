Do you have a problem that is not documented below? No matter how trivial the problem might be, please raise an issue.

#### ImportError: No module named pyclibrary

You have not installed PyCLibrary, or you are using two different python installations (i.e., one installed via apt-get, and one installed from source in a local directory, or one in a virtual environment). Make sure you are using the same Python to install libraries as you are to run programs. Get PyCLibrary from [here](https://github.com/MatthieuDartiailh/pyclibrary).
