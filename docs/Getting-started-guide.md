# Getting started guide

For a quick demo of Bifrost to whet your appetite, please check out our online demo at [GitHub Pages](bifrost.github.io). If you have already installed Bifrost, look below to [Creating your first pipeline](#tutorial)

## Installation

Bifrost requires several dependencies, depending on how you want to use it. If you don't know what you are doing, you should assume that you want all the dependencies - we will walk you through this process.

### Python dependencies

*Bifrost is written in Python 2.7.* If you would like us to support Python 3.x, please let us know your interest.

- pip 

pip is a package manager for other Python dependencies. Once you have pip, installing additional python dependencies should become straightforward. 

- PyCLibrary
